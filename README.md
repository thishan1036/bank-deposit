# Boosting Marketing Efficiency: Drive Targeted Bank Campaigns by Customer Subscription Behavior

### Business Problem
Banks waste significant marketing budget on broad, untargeted campaigns, leading to inefficient budget spend and high customer acquisition costs. With limited marketing resources, they need to identify how to prioritize outreach, thus minimize missed opportunities and wasted effort on uninterested leads. The core challenge is to **transform marketing from a wide net into a precision spear.**

### Hypothesis & Proposed Solution
**Hypothesis:** Customers with certain demographic profiles (age, job stability) and positive past campaign reponses are significantly more likely to subscribe to term deposits. A logistic regression model can identify these high-probability segments.

**Proposed Solution:** Build a classification model that generates probability scores for targeted outreach. The core focus is analyzing the business trade-off between **precision and recall** - enabling the bank to choose between high-efficiency campaigns (targeting only top prospects) or broader outreach to maximize total conversions.

### Key Questions to Answer
- Which customer attributes are the strongest predictors of term deposit subscription, and how can these insights inform future marketing and targeting strategy?

- What is the quantifiable business trade off between broader outreach campaign (high recall) and targeted marketing strategy (high precision)?

- What is the recommended data-driven strategy based on model performance that the bank should implement to balance maximum marketing ROI with the risk of missing potential conversions?
